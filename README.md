OVERVIEW
Our idea for a game is a cave crawler, with the main goal of the player to escape by navigating through the cave, using your flashlight to avoid traps and deter monsters

AMY - Created assets for ghost.png, separated + optimised code, helped come up with concept ideas, created all level design + added all code except (sketch.js: 63, 67, 76, 146-154, player.js: 8, 9, 10, 11, 35, 49, 56, 83-88, levels.js: 3, 8-15, 39, 40, 55, 56, 61, 65, p5.sound.js, p5.sound.min.js, animation.js, preload.js: 3-15, 25, 26, 29-35).

EVERYONE - aided in fixing code

If we have more time, we would have liked to introduce a ghost enemy that would spawn randomly behind the player and kill them if they moved or didn't turn around and face the ghost within a few (probably 5) seconds. Also we would have liked to introduce animations for the player walking, hearts and explosions.

THEMES
Horror/Thriller

GAME DESIGN
At the current stage of our project:
- the player is able to move around
- flashlight effect around the player
- obstacles
- lose lives when player interacts with the hole.png
- win/lose component

In the future, we are aiming to add a monster enemy, that spawns along the edge of the map and works its way toward the player, which the player will need to shine their flashlight at to scare away/kill.

AESTHETIC
8-bit horror game graphics often feature with a limited colour palette to create a retro and nostalgic atmosphere.
Dark and eerie environment enhances the sense of dread.
//sound: maybe 
low-fi, synth sound
