THEMES
Horror/Thriller

GAME DESIGN
At the current stage of our project:
- the player is able to move around
- flashlight effect around the player
- obstacles
- lose lives when player interacts with the hole.png
- win/lose component

In the future, we are aiming to add a monster enemy, that spawns along the edge of the map and works its way toward the player, which the player will need to shine their flashlight at to scare away/kill.

AESTHETIC
8-bit horror game graphics often feature with a limited colour palette to create a retro and nostalgic atmosphere.
Dark and eerie environment enhances the sense of dread.
//sound: maybe 
low-fi, synth sound
